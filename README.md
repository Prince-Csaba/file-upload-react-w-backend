A short school project made with my team for practicing the backend-frontend connection. Built a basic server with Node js and Express js, than made frontend file upload with Javascipt and then with React.

## Installation

First install the dependencies for both the frontend2 and the backend by running

```bash
-npm install
```
## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
