A short school project made with my team for practicing the backend-frontend connection. Built a basic server with Node js and Express js, than made frontend file upload with Javascipt and then with React.

## Installation

First install the dependencies for both the frontend2 and the backend by running.

```bash
-npm install
```
For the backend part you need to have [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

## Usage

Run the backend using Node Js (you can use Nodemon as well).

```bash
node server.js
```
Run the React app with yarn or npm.

```bash
yarn start or
npm start
```
